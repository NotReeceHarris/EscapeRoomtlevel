This Facility is not simply the fruitless work of some pathetic scientist. \nThis house was built by the Genius Clovis Bray I himself. Within lies humanity's salvation. La fontaine de jouvence. \nMade possible by Clarity control. \nMagnificant, wasn't it? An entity beyond our own dimension.\nAnd the answer to Humanity's eternal struggle. Mortality.\nWere it to fall into the wrong hands, humanity, and the universe, would be utterly doomed.\nI have no reason to believe you are anything other than the wrong hands.\nYou now face Godlike Judgement. May it extend eternally.'\nThe Intercom shut off and an Alarm was booming across the station. You should probably find a way to stop whatever is happening."
